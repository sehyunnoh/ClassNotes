41. List three major access control models.
ANSWER:  	There are five major access control models: Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Role Based Access Control (RBAC), Rule Based Access Control (RBAC), and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).


42. Describe the two key elements of the MAC model.
ANSWER:  	Labels. In a system using MAC, every entity is an object (laptops, files, projects, and so on) and is assigned a classification label. These labels represent the relative importance of the object, such as confidential, secret, and top secret. Subjects (users, processes, and so on) are assigned a privilege label (sometimes called a clearance). Levels. A hierarchy based on the labels is also used, both for objects and subjects. Top secret has a higher level than secret, which has a higher level than confidential.


45. Discuss the two significant weaknesses of DAC.
ANSWER:  	DAC has two significant weaknesses. First, although it gives a degree of freedom to the subject, DAC poses risks in that it relies on decisions by the end user to set the proper level of security. As a result, incorrect permissions might be granted to a subject or permissions might be given to an unauthorized subject. A second weakness is that a subject's permissions will be "inherited" by any programs that the subject executes. Attackers often take advantage of this inheritance because end users in the DAC model often have a high level of privileges. Malware that is downloaded onto a user's computer would then run in the same context as the user's high privileges. Trojans are a particular problem with DAC.

47. Describe LDAP injection attacks.
ANSWER:  	A weakness of LDAP is that it can be subject to LDAP injection attacks. These attacks, similar to SQL injection attacks, can occur when user input is not properly filtered. This may allow an attacker to construct LDAP statements based on user input statements. The attacker could then retrieve information from the LDAP database or modify its content. The defense against LDAP injection attacks is to examine all user input before processing.

48. Describe how Kerberos works.
ANSWER:  	Kerberos is typically used when a user attempts to access a network service and that service requires authentication. The user is provided a ticket that is issued by the Kerberos authentication server, much as a driver's license is issued by the DMV. This ticket contains information linking it to the user. The user presents this ticket to the network for a service. The service then examines the ticket to verify the identity of the user. If the user is verified, they are then accepted. Kerberos tickets share some of the same characteristics as a driver's license: tickets are difficult to copy (because they are encrypted), they contain specific user information, they restrict what a user can do, and they expire after a few hours or a day. Issuing and submitting tickets in a Kerberos system is handled internally and is transparent to the user.




50. What is the purpose of an ACL?
ANSWER:  	ACLs provide file system security for protecting files managed by the OS. ACLs have also been ported to SQL and relational database systems so that ACLs can provide database security as well. ACLs are the oldest and most basic form of access control.
